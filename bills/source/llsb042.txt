That the United States soon after the execution of said deed took possession of the ground first above described and so intended to be conveyed, and built a light-house thereon, inclosed it with a fence, and thence hitherto have held the exclusive possession thereof, and have never asserted title to any other property under said deed; and Whereas the said Elston was the owner of all the land adjoining said ground and retained possession thereof, and afterward sold and conveyed the same to innocent purchasers, who, or those claiming under such conveyances, caused the same to be platted and laid out into town lots as an addition to Michgan City, and which said town lots were laid out with reference to the land so taken possession of and fenced by the United States, and which said land and town lots are now held and possessed in good faith by the remote vendees of said Elston: Now therefore, For the purpose of correcting said mistake and releasing all right, title, or interest which the United States may have by virtue of the error in said deed of said Elston: Therefore,","Committee on Public Lands"

Smyth, of the city of Wilmington, Delaware, on the breaking out of the rebellion in eighteen hundred and sixty-one, raised a company of men and tendered them for three months' service to the United States, in answer to the call of President Lincoln for seventy-five thousand volunteers; after serving three months, he returned to Wilmington, Delaware, with his company, and was mustered into the volunteer service of the United States as major of the First Delaware Regiment; soon afterward the First Delaware left for the seat of war, and Major Thomas A. Smyth, who was with the regiment in all its memorable engagements, was promoted for gallant and meritorious conduct on the battle-field, as follows: To lieutenant-colonel, December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two; to colonel, March nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three; to brigadier-general, October first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and to brevet major-general, on the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and died at Burkesville, Virginia, on the ninth of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, from wounds received at the battle of Farmville, Virginia, two days previous; and Whereas the said Brevet Major-General Thomas A. Smyth was actively engaged in the military service of the Republic during the whole of the late civil war, until he fell at the head of his column mortally wounded, leading the advance of the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the very last charge, and in the last great fight of the seventh of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, previous to the surrender of the rebel General R. E. Lee; and Whereas the said General Thomas A. Smyth, while commissioned as major from October seventeenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, to December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, performed the duties of colonel and had command of the regiment; and when commissioned lieutenant-colonel, December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and colonel, March nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, and as brigadier-general, October first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, until the day of his death-wound, had assigned to him the command of brigades and divisions, and by alternates performed the duties of brigadier and major general; while acting as colonel he received only the pay of major, and while acting as brigadier and major general, only the pay of lieutenant-colonel and colonel; and Whereas the widow and child of the said late General Thomas A.

A Bill Granting the right of way to the Elyton, Corinth and Tennessee River Railroad Company through the public domain, and for other purposes. Whereas Northwestern Alabama contains a large amount of wild and unsalable lands which have remained on the hands of the Government for many years; and Whereas these lands are remotely situated from navigable rivers and railroads, among rugged mountains and difficult of access, and but poorly adapted to agricultural pursuits; and Whereas the inhabitants of this region of country have no means for the transportation of the fruits of their labor to and from the usual market, except by the common wagon over rough roads, at a great expense of personal exposure, time, and labor; and Whereas, for the causes above enumerated, this region must ever remain sparsely settled and undeveloped until brought under the influence of the only adequate means yet found for the development and utilization of such countries--the railroad; and Whereas this region covers an area equivalent to one hundred miles square, or ten thousand square miles, which must be traversed by the Elyton, Corinth and Tennessee Railroad diagonally, from the southeast to the northwest, for a distance of one hundred and thirty miles in the State of Alabama, and which presents no means whatever of adequate local contributions to the cost of constructing said road; and Whereas the said railroad is deemed of national importance by the great communities of the Northwestern and Southwestern States of the Union, connecting, as it does, the great railway system of the South, concentering at Birmingham, Alabama, from all the ports of the South Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, with the navigable waters and railway system of the great Northwest, thus bringing these two great communities of the nation into direct, cheap, and easy communication, by which they can exchange the commodities of their respective countries with great reciprocal advantages; and Whereas the said railroad will, by developing the natural resources of the country through which it runs, greatly enhance the national and State revenues, while it subserves the wants of the people as a desideratum to their progress, prosperity and happiness; and Whereas for the reasons above enumerated the said railroad cannot be constructed without some special basis for its financiering by which large amounts of cash capital can be attracted from other communities to aid in its creation, and which must remain unproductive for a number of years, as is usual in such cases; Therefore","Committee on Public Lands"
